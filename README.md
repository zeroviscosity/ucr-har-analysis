# UCR HAR Analysis

### Getting And Cleaning Data Assignment

This project uses the dataset on Human Activity Recognition available from UCI:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The provided R script, `run_analysis.R`, downloads and unzips the dataset. It then 
combines the training and test datasets before summarizing the observations and
saving the resulting dataset as a CSV file called `tidy.csv`.

The `CodeBook.md` file contains a description of the resulting tidy dataset, along 
with a description of the steps taken in creating it.
